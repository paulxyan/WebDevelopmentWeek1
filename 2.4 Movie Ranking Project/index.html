<h1> Best Movies According to Paul</h1>
<h2> Paul Yan's Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Goodfellas </h3>
<p> In my opinion one of the best gangster movies of all time, and also depicts the complicated moral lives of people <br />
Growing up in a mafia family in New York. It also captures really well the stories of each character and makes you feel connected to them
</p>

<h3>Justice League Crisis on Two Earths</h3>
<p> One of the greatest DC animated films and is just a fun to watch action movie which contains my favourite villain, Owlman <br />
Watching him justify his actions with his nihilistic views on life made it a more interesting film to watch as grew up
</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p> My favourite Harry Potter movie since I think the acting was the best in this movie, also the first time <br /> Death eaters were introduced and we got to see Gary Oldman play Sirius black!</p>
